# Information Gathering

## Find hosts
Sometimes a host has more than one ip   
`netdiscover -r <network>.0/24 [-i interface]`

## Port Scanning
+ nmap    
First thing is to run nmap doing version detection, scripting and OS fingerprinting

````nmap -n -sV -A -p- <ip>````

`-sS` -> TCP, `-sU` -> UDP, `-A` -> OS, service, scripts, `-sV` -> service, `-p <ports>` -> specific ports, `-n` -> don't do DNS resolution, `-O` -> OS fingerprint, `-Pn` -> no ping, `--top-ports <ports>` -> scan for most common ports 

Consider using zenmap or esparta which use nmap underneath and provide a UI with additional functionality

+ netcat    
```
for i in `seq 1 65535`; do nc -z -v <ip> $i 2>&1 | grep 'open'; done
```
or    
`nc -v -n -z -wl <ip> <from port>-<to port>`    
udp    
`nc ‐nv ‐u ‐z ‐w 1 <ip> <from port>-<to port>`
