# Information Gathering

## Find hosts
Sometimes a host has more than one ip   
```netdiscover -r <network>.0/24 [-i interface]```

## Port Scanning
First thing is to run nmap doing version detection, scripting and OS fingerprinting

````nmap -n -sV -A -p- <ip>````

`-sS` -> TCP, `-sU` -> UDP, `-A` -> OS, service, scripts, `-sV` -> service, `-p <ports>` -> specific ports, `-n` -> don't do DNS resolution, `-O` -> OS fingerprint 

Consider using zenmap or esparta which use nmap underneath and provide a UI with additional functionality
