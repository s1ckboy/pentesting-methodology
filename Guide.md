# Information Gathering

## Find hosts
Sometimes a host has more than one ip
    netdiscover -r <network>.0/24

## Port Scanning
First thing is to run nmap on TCP doing version detection, scripting and OS fingerprinting

    nmap -sS -A <ip>
Consider using zenmap or esparta which use nmap underneath and provide a UI with additional functionality
