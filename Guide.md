# Information Gathering

## Find hosts
Sometimes a host has more than one ip   
```netdiscover -r <network>.0/24 [-i interface]```

## Port Scanning
First thing is to run nmap on TCP doing version detection, scripting and OS fingerprinting   
`-sS` -> TCP, `-sU` -> UDP, `-A` -> OS, service, scripts, `-sV` -> service, `-p <ports>` -> specific ports 

    nmap -sS -A <ip>
Consider using zenmap or esparta which use nmap underneath and provide a UI with additional functionality
